    Reads in a h5features file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : filename
        hdf5 file potentially serving as a container for many small files
    group : str
        h5 group to read the data from
    from_internal_file : str, optional
        Read the data strating from this file. (defaults to the first stored
        file)
    to_internal_file : str, optional
        Read the data until reaching the file. (defaults to from_internal_file
        if it was specified and to the last stored file otherwise)
    from_time : float, optional
        (defaults to the beginning time in from_internal_file)
        the specified times are included in the output
    to_time : float, optional
        (defaults to the ending time in to_internal_file)
        the specified times are included in the output
    index : int, optional
        (for faster access)

    Returns
    -------
    times : dict
        a dictionary of 1D arrays
    features : dict
        a dictionary of 2D arrays with the 'feature' dimension along the
        columns and the 'time' dimension along the lines

    .. note:: Note that all the files that are present on disk between file1
        and file2 will be loaded and returned. It's the responsibility
        of the user to make sure that it will fit into RAM memory.

    .. note:: Also note that the functions are not concurrent nor thread-safe
        (because the HDF5 library is not concurrent and not always
        thread-safe), moreover, they aren't even atomic for independent
        process (because there are several independent calls to the file
        system), so that thread-safety and atomicity of operations should be
        enforced externally when necessary.
