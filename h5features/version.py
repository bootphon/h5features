"""Provides versioning facilities to the h5features package.

This module manages the h5features **file format versions**, specified
as strings in the format 'major.minor'. File format versions are
independant of the h5feature package version (but actually follow the
same numerotation scheme).

The module provides functions to list supported versions, read a
version from a h5features file or check a specific version is
supported.
