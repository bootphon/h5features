"""This package defines a standard to read/write features from/to HDF5 files.

.. note::

   **The functions are not concurrent nor thread-safe**
   because the HDF5 library is not concurrent and not always
   thread-safe. Moreover, they aren't even atomic for independent
   process (because there are several independent calls to the
   file system), so that thread-safety and atomicity of
   operations should be enforced externally when necessary.
